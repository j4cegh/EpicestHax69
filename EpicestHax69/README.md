# EpicestHax69
`ˈɛpɪkɪst hæks`

A free and open source *(?)* alternative to other **free** Roblox injectors.

*From now on I'll refer to EpicestHax69 as EHX for simplicity.*

# Why?
EHX gets rid of those annoying key systems and instead attaches to Roblox and injects your favorite scripts on demand. 
It's written in modern C# and prioritizes functionality rather than user interface.

# Why does it look so terrible?
I've intentionally designed EHX in a painfully terrible yet functional way
to prove that you do not need fancy UI to make an app function properly.

# How do I install and run this?
As of the time I'm writing this, there are no compiled builds, but I have been working hard to make it happen 
and it most likely will soon.

You can also attempt compiling it, but I do not guarantee that everything is going to happen smoothly.
